## 🧭 Overview

**SpatialCL** is a *plug-and-play contrastive learning framework* designed for spatially structured modalities, including **RGB**, **thermal**, and **3D** data.  
It robustly handles *intra-* and *inter-class variability*, enabling consistent embeddings across challenging datasets.

🧪 As a demonstration of its capabilities, **SpatialCL** has been applied in **[DiSCO 🔗](https://github.com/your-link-here)** — *Detection of Spills in Indoor environments using weakly supervised contrastive learning* — showcasing its practical impact in real-world spill detection scenarios.

⚙️ While the framework is **modality-agnostic** and can be extended to other dense spatial tasks, extending **SpatialCL** to sparse, graph-structured data such as **skeletons** represents an exciting direction for future work.
